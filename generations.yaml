    description: "The Volvo S70 was essentially a significantly facelifted and renamed continuation of the Volvo 850 sedan, introduced in late 1996 as a 1997 model. While sharing the same core platform and mechanical components with the 850, the S70 featured smoother, more rounded exterior styling that moved away from the distinctly boxy design of its predecessor. The interior was also comprehensively redesigned with improved ergonomics, updated materials, and enhanced safety features. Powertrains carried over from the 850, consisting of various five-cylinder engines in naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, with outputs ranging from approximately 126 to 250 horsepower. Transmission options included 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic gearboxes, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available on certain turbo models (badged as S70 AWD). The S70 maintained Volvo's reputation for safety innovation, featuring the Side Impact Protection System (SIPS), Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), and side airbags. Despite its relatively short production run before being replaced by the S60, the S70 represented an important transitional model that helped modernize Volvo's design language while maintaining the brand's core values of safety, durability, and practicality."
